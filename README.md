# Breakthrough
CS591 Artificial Intelligence Project2

This is the second group project for our Artificial Intelligence course. For this project, we will be working with our group and using Python to implement an agent to play a simple 2-player zero-sum game called Breakthrough.

What is Breakthrough:
Breakthrough is an abstract strategy board game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000 and made available as a Zillions of Games file (ZRF). It won the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition, even though the game was originally played on a 7x7 board, as it is trivially extensible to larger board sizes. The game has a very simple ruleset, however, the strategies that can be implemented can become very complex.

Rules of Breakthrough:
- The game board is an 8x8 grid and each player has 16 workers (or pieces) in their team.
- The pieces are initially set up with 2 rows of 8 on each side of the board, with one side's pieces being black, and the other's white.
- White will make the first move, then players will alternate turns.
- A piece may move one space forward or diagonally forward if the target square is empty.
- A piece may move into a square containing an opponent's piece if and only if that square is one step diagonally forward.
- Pieces may not move sideways, backward, or diagonally backward. Pieces can not take an opponent's piece if it is directly forward, only diagonally forward.

Rules and game description can be found on the BREAKTHROUGH WIKIPEDIA PAGE.
